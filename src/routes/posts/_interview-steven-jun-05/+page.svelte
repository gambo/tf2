Transcript 24 June 2025, 06:08am Steven Joubert started transcription Shaun Richardson 0:05 Went to
here in New Zealand too. A little bit of rain, yeah. Nice to hear from you, buddy. We've worked
together in the past from quite a few years, actually. Steven Joubert 0:14 It's close to 20 years.
Shaun Richardson 0:16 Close to 20 years Can you believe it's right? Steven Joubert 0:19 That's
crazy. Shaun Richardson 0:20 Yeah. So like the whole format of this interview is just, you know,
there's a lot you can glean from someone's career if you just ask the right questions and the whole
I'll just meet so many amazing people in my career that. Just sit down. I'll see you. A few
questions. Put it up on the website because you know, intuition and and enlightenment can come from
anywhere. So I thought, well, I'm going to ask you a few questions. I think that we can learn a lot
from you. Steven Joubert 0:44 Yeah. Oh, good. OK, all good. All say you nice to see where this
actually leads. So it'll. This is my. This is my. This is my first interview. So I also nervous but
yeah. Shaun Richardson 0:51 Yeah. There it goes. Yeah. Well, I mean, you know, I mean it's part and
parcel of being a software developer, isn't it? A lot of software developers are imposters and drone
because, you know, we're just, it tends to feel like we're just kind of stumbling through and
everyone else seems to be the experts. But actually. Once you break it down, we're actually doing
OK. Steven Joubert 1:27 Yeah, exactly. Shaun Richardson 1:29 Why do you think it affects software
developers more than other people? In other industries. Steven Joubert 1:36 I think it's because
there's such a big, vast. Span in the industry that there's so many avenues, so many directions that
even in your expertise your level of know you you you can't possibly know everything you can't
possibly know the entire realm of of of of the industry that you can know your small section and you
kind of need to fake it in every other so I imagine it's it's definitely an imposter syndrome. When
I'm talking to other developers outside of my small key, you just got a nod and smile and and and
you can throw in your little two cents, but you gotta make sure that you're not revealing your your
your limited knowledge in that field. Shaun Richardson 2:22 We are definitely. I felt the same, you
know, because you go into a room of very smart people who are in a comfortable environment and
they're just talking you like, whoa, I'm clearly in the wrong room. But there was, like, a saying
that I, like, is that everybody's got blind spots. Steven Joubert 2:24 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Shaun
Richardson 2:39 And I don't where exactly I picked it up, but it really like it sunk, you know, deep
into my my sakes is that yeah, everyone does have blind spots and some of them can be, yeah. Steven
Joubert 2:49 I think that's the awareness. Yes, you need to just be. You need to just be confident
in what you do know. 'cause, that's The thing is, we aren't where we are because we don't know
anything. We're we're not fumbling through the entire industry. We're actually we're we're 20 years
experienced in our industry. Shaun Richardson 2:56 Yeah. Steven Joubert 3:08 Where that's it's it's
starting web development. Like literally a lot stuff, but now it's getting into the heavy the back
end framework stuff. So it's very much more like we are we are able, we are highly competent. Shaun
Richardson 3:17 Yeah. Steven Joubert 3:21 But in our our field, which is why you kinda need to throw
out that like impostor syndrome sounds sounds of it. But it's coming back to the faking it till
you're making it. You need to you do know what you do know, but you also don't know what you don't
know. Go. Shaun Richardson 3:40 You know, and the whole thing is, I suppose it's fine. If you don't
know something, do you want to be the person who's like I got you? I got it covered. I'm going to
get it done. I don't know what I'm doing right now, but I'm going to go and I'm going to learn up
and I think it's a very positive quality to have. It's not a negative quality, but when you say
impostor syndrome, it does have this kind of negative connotation, you know, to it. Steven Joubert
4:00 Yes. No. It really does. Yeah. It really does. And that's why I think, you know, just maybe
framing it or framing it differently is not. It's more of a we have a mindset that is of a learned
nature where you don't stop learning, you don't stop learning, and then I'm not sitting in a room
feeling like an impostor. I'm more like sitting in a room learning more. Shaun Richardson 4:09 Yeah.
Yes, definitely. Steven Joubert 4:29 So you kind of need a balance there. You need a balance there
because you are taking in everything and then if something does spark something in you, then you do,
you go and learn more because actually didn't know that or I didn't know that to the extent or I had
this completely wrong. So you, so you're learning and I think that is in our industry it's very much
a tinker world where you have to fumble. Shaun Richardson 4:46 Yeah. Steven Joubert 4:55 And and try
and try and fail and try and fail. And I think in in my aspect that's kind of where. This has been
the. Why it's I've drawn or gravitated to it because it's a very much a trial and error environment
until you get it right and then you're like right, this is right. This is how it is. Shaun
Richardson 5:14 You know, I've never actually looked at that before. You know, you look at it from
the perspective of the hacker, the hacker culture and the hacker culture. It's it's called hack for
a reason. They would hack and smash and break in and mould and and just absolutely power through
problems until you know, that was the hacker culture. And you don't look at a hacker culture and
say, like, these guys don't know what they're doing. Steven Joubert 5:19 Yeah. Yeah. Shaun
Richardson 5:39 They don't, but they're breaking and twisting and adapting and moulding and
building. Until they've kind of, you know, done whatever they want to do, that's the heck away.
Steven Joubert 5:49 And then at the end of it, they do know what they're doing. Shaun Richardson
5:52 Yeah, 'cause, they've learnt through the whole process. Steven Joubert 5:53 You know, and now
you take that sort of skills to the next problem and you don't start by not knowing, you start with
what you do know. And you and you and you bold on that. You bold on what you now find out what you
don't know. And and then you now learn more. And I think that is the mindset that the mindset is
very much of A forever student. Where I'm always gonna be learning. Shaun Richardson 6:21 It's it's
very much for every student and and I like I think software developers do a lot of reading and you
know, if you do reading. Steven Joubert 6:24 Yeah. Yeah. Shaun Richardson 6:33 You do large kind of
sections of reading you might come across something else or like I remember. When you're just
reading up on SQL and you like that dead cool, I'm learning database stuff and then someone comes up
to you and says hey man, have you heard about that squeal? That's real. What's real? Steven Joubert
6:53 Yeah. Shaun Richardson 6:53 And it's just because they had read it as squeal. Steven Joubert
6:56 Yeah. Shaun Richardson 6:58 You you'd read it as SQL and and that's when you kind of pick up
that. There's these, there can be these blind spots, you know, all over the place. Steven Joubert
7:00 Yes. Yeah. Shaun Richardson 7:08 But I mean like if we if we take, you know, blind spots kind
of out of the equation here, right. And we say like, well, you specifically you're a specialist
project manager for for a loan finance house, right. And we're not talking small stuff here. We're
talking pretty serious heavy regulated stuff. And they come up to you with a project. And remember
that like software development, project management is your skill set. It's not necessarily loan
finance. I'm pretty sure you come across situations where you're like I have no idea what these guys
are asking. Steven Joubert 7:37 Yeah. Shaun Richardson 7:43 So do you feel that even today it's the
same as it was when you were younger? Or do you feel like you're just adapt to the whole, maybe not
knowing certain things better? Steven Joubert 7:56 I think that's where experience does come into
play, where I do know that I don't know the whole entire realm of everything, but I've got a team.
That together we can hash out any problem. So if it's, if it's in terms of a, a business or a
financial problem that that might be outside of my realm of expertise. I can have the the I can have
that problem dumbed down to me. Dumbed down explained in a way that we cannot manage it and once we
can have the explanation of the situation. Broken down. Then then any job is manageable. I think. I
think that's my skill sets. My skill set is is to break down problems to make them manageable and
bits. Because if you look at a big project, it's very daunting to see, OK, well, I need to get from
no product to a finished product and this is what the client wins along the way. Well, this is what
this is, what the client wants. And then with a team that you can help with the breaking down the
problem, whether it's a technical level or whether it's a business problem. Shaun Richardson 8:43
Yeah. Steven Joubert 9:08 The the together with the team, you can break it down or you can have it
explained so that you can break it down so that it can be manageable. Because once you have, once
you have it broken down, you can. You can put together a timeline. I can put together a problem list
so that maybe you do have a critical problem that I can't go further until this is a this is solved.
Then you can maybe put more resources towards that. You can focus energy, you can focus. Shaun
Richardson 9:16 Yeah. Steven Joubert 9:34 Maybe have workshops. Sorry. Sit down and discuss. Well,
sit down and discuss how we how do we get past this problem or how do we understand this problem
that it can be broken down? Because maybe then at that point the problem is still too big to be
looked at. Shaun Richardson 9:42 OK. And you know actually the. Steven Joubert 9:53 So then you need
to break it down further so that I find is there is the faking until you're making it is very much
more a I don't think I have that problem anymore. Shaun Richardson 10:10 Yeah. Steven Joubert 10:10
The team makes a difference and I know I'll come to you with problems that I'm like, well, this is a
technical problem and I don't understand how to get through that. And then you you can show me and
this is how we go about that and then that's great. So I have resources like you. That, or in the
finance realm, where if it does go over my head, I I know that. I'll be able to. I'll be able to
apply on my skills in the right way with the right team, yeah. Shaun Richardson 10:35 We've got a
reliable task force, yeah. I kinda like that I'm going back to what you said earlier where you like
you. You need to break it down into a problem that is manageable and and and I kind of picked up
that that happens on a speech level too because of course you don't know all of accounting if you're
a programmer who happens to find a programming job in an accounting software house, you know it
should be quite obvious to everybody. But you know very often it gets missed. And we a client will
come to you and say I need a bar, quarterly transfer port for the assets and you're like that's just
a bunch of meet up words. I have no idea what that means, but if you. Steven Joubert 11:19 Yeah, I
can break each one of them. I can break each one down to A to a single thing, but putting them
together, I don't really know what you're looking for. Shaun Richardson 11:26 Exactly. So if you
actually like break it down and you say, OK, well, I need, you know, a quarterly report. OK, cool
it. It runs four times a year, et cetera, et cetera. Then all of a sudden, you can start bullying
for this thing or start planning for it appropriately. And, like, I also, I'm picking up like,
working with the team. Obviously, I've worked with you in the past. And one of the benefits that
I've picked up working, working with you is we always, we buy it all together. We always have the
same kind of tenacity to get problems. Steven Joubert 11:34 Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Shaun Richardson 11:56
So when I saw you on a team somewhere close by, I was like Nah, nice, you know, like I've got, I've.
I've got that play on the field almost. And then, you know, sometimes you've got a whole bunch of
new players that you don't know and learning about who brings what to the table is like an exciting
time because you like. Steven Joubert 12:01 Yeah. Yes. Shaun Richardson 12:18 A kind of I really
enjoy exploring that space. Like, who is this person? I I kind of believe that everybody on the team
has a team, has something to deliver. Like inspiration can come from absolutely any corner in your
organisation and I've been proven correct so many times that if you just take the time to listen.
Steven Joubert 12:28 Absolutely, yeah. Shaun Richardson 12:43 With thought and care that you know,
if you, I guess what I'm trying to say is if you shut down people eagerly, you're actually doing
your job worse. Steven Joubert 12:52 You said you're doing yourself an injustice because exactly
like you say it can't from anywhere. And I think that's another strong part is it's it's very much.
Shaun Richardson 12:54 Yeah. Steven Joubert 13:01 It's a social thing that you now need to learn to
say. OK, well, I know that I need to turn to this person or to this team or to this. To find the
correct person that helps me with this problem, you know, maybe you have a key person that was is a
specialist in this area. Shaun Richardson 13:17 Yes. Steven Joubert 13:23 But then maybe they don't
have the time, so you're like, OK, well. And then then it comes down to a social environment that
you're like, OK, well, how do I then go about this? Who else knows? And you don't? You don't know
until you're actually finding out. So it's very important to get to know your team. Shaun Richardson
13:32 Yeah. Yeah, 100%. I remember very much. Like you said that this person may be busy. I've had a
few times. The person's been incredibly busy. So you're like, man, I need this person's intelligence
on this situation. I need their input. So I'm going to do my best to make sure that I can come in
with a light load, give them highly targeted information so I can get the results. You know, in out.
And so that I do not disturb them. Like, I'm adapting myself to that person. Steven Joubert 13:51
Yeah. Yes, yes. Yes. Shaun Richardson 14:07 To make sure that they're smooth. Steven Joubert 14:10
Yeah, I know you do. You need to and I think then also the nice thing when you start breaking the
problem down exactly like you say now you make it a concise problem. You break down the problem to
the point that you understand the problem Even so much better that there's sometimes while you're
explaining the problem for the third time. Now you even come to the own revelation of what you're
going through and you're like, ah, thank you for just being a year here because I've kind of worked
it out myself. Shaun Richardson 14:12 You know. Yeah. Yeah. Do you have the whole rubber duck thing?
You know, just by talking through the situation? Steven Joubert 14:40 Yeah. Just by talking through
it. Yes. Yeah, you you kind of hash it out and I think it's it's. It's when you when you change up
an A problem that's when you take it from it's in your head you're seeing it visually it's in your
head it's nowhere else besides what you're looking at. And now when you speak it out which is what I
found a lot of times you can just taking a break from a problem helps with a problem. Shaun
Richardson 14:44 You've kind of hopped on to us on to a solution. Yes. Yeah. Steven Joubert 15:09
Because then you can go. You can. You can take it on a run. You can take it on a drive. You can wake
up with the next day. And some so often the solution just comes. You're like, ah, well, let's try
this and and and and either it works or it puts you in the right step. You know, it's a lot of times
I've solved problems in that way. Shaun Richardson 15:22 It. And that's funny because. Yeah. And you
know, there's a parallel to cognitive behavioural therapy, which is used to, you know, address
anxiety, a whole umbrella of anxiety disorders and stuff like that. And what they tell you is you
should write it down. Steven Joubert 15:46 Yeah. Shaun Richardson 15:46 Because the very act of
converting the emotions in your head down into a sentence. It kind of takes away the power if you
haven't described what you're feeling. It's just kind of this big black mess of. Steven Joubert
15:57 Yes. Shaun Richardson 16:01 Of panic. But if you've written it down into a sentence saying I
need to deliver this report by Tuesday, all of a sudden it's not as scary anymore. Steven Joubert
16:11 Yeah, it's just it's broken down the problem. Yes, yes. Shaun Richardson 16:13 It's that kind
of act of framing it. Yeah, but OK, so now we've been talking about like. How do we prepare? How do
we kind of frame ourselves, but that this kind of shift the conversation? From to actual delivery to
the clients, right? So a client will come into you and say we need XYZ. We've just spoken for last
for 15 minutes over like how do we prepare ourselves to deliver this XYZ? Now let's just say we've
got over their phase. I've often found that like when you're in the delivery phase, there's always
areas you could Polish. There's always areas you could spend more time on, so I'm asking you as a as
an expert in this field, I've seen you breakthrough boundaries and barriers and deliver high quality
work consistently. Where do you make the distinction, you know, where do you say like I need to stop
working on this now? I need to deliver to the clients. Steven Joubert 17:22 So the the the primary
thing is OK, the scope of the project. Shaun Richardson 17:22 What's the intuition there? Steven
Joubert 17:28 Emma within scope, there's a lot of stuff that's master haves, but it's outside of the
scope, so you need to make sure that you're not spending hours and hours 'cause. I mean any of these
problems, any nice to have, even honestly, sometimes if it's a nice to have if you can just throw it
in with it being something you know, then you can add it in. But you you always find that these
things not cause scope creep. So no you you have to. You have to. You have to stay within your
bounds of your scope and now you know that you're delivering what your scope is doing. So your scope
is requiring. So once you have that. Shaun Richardson 18:03 So now let's just assume that you say
this. Steven Joubert 18:04 Then then what you're saying is about. Shaun Richardson 18:09 Sorry, you
can carry on. Steven Joubert 18:11 What you're saying about Polish is I think there's even a level
of, you know, that your software can always be improved on at any stage. Shaun Richardson 18:21
Yeah. Steven Joubert 18:22 Once you've finished the project, even once you signed off, you're like
you know what if I did this right it from scratch, I would do it so much better. Or you come back to
the project in three months or in a year's time. You're like, who wrote this, you know? Really this
this person is a such a such a novice. This is a rookie programme. And that's always going to be the
case, because every project you're learning on, you're you're you're growing on. And by the end of
that project, you you can probably come back with a best practises. Shaun Richardson 18:40 Yes, yes.
Steven Joubert 18:52 Result as to what what you would do better, what you would. But your product's
already finished. It's already fulfilling your requirements. So in that way you can't. You can't hit
the drawing board every time because you're never going to get it anywhere in that case. So I
literally get to the point of I take it as a project based and once I have each solution. The term
provided or or or solved. You then incorporate that into the project. You can't. You can't. Now go
back and reinvestigate or re rehash it. What you can do is you can take that stuff that you've
learned and you apply to the new project. That way you start in a new project so much better, so
much stronger. But the stuff that you've done some the the little pieces of the puzzle, the little
pieces of the puzzle that you've put together. Shaun Richardson 19:32 I don't care so. Steven
Joubert 19:39 You work with them. You've made-up, you've made a programme where you've made a
function. Now you use that function to the best of that function that functions ability. If you
needed to make a new function, there could probably be redone, but the minute you start rehashing
functions. Or programmes. And you make them overly complicated, but you're you're very you're very
good at. This is to make a brilliant function that can cover that. That is rock solid. Shaun
Richardson 20:05 Yeah, I I do. Yeah. Steven Joubert 20:27 Maybe you can relook at it in the future,
but you get to a point that you like keku. I need to move on and honestly. The the strategy is to
you want to have a neat code base. Shaun Richardson 20:43 Yeah. Steven Joubert 20:43 But if if
you're going to now overly complicate things and then have to add conditions and add things you you
need to find the line and go like right. This puzzle piece is done. Let me let me let me move on.
It's now if I if I can use it in this way, I'm using it, otherwise I need to do something else. And.
Shaun Richardson 21:02 So if I can like Recon like, let me try narrow down on this 'cause. I think
I've fixed it up. Is there you say you were working through a project and you and you you said like
this could use Polish, you know it could use Polish, but you've ticked you've ticked it, it
delivers. Steven Joubert 21:16 Yes. At any point, Joe. Shaun Richardson 21:22 Instead of dwelling on
it, you say to yourself something along the lines of. I'll leave the Polish until this time on
another project. Steven Joubert 21:33 It's very much. Shaun Richardson 21:33 Is that the intuition?
Steven Joubert 21:35 It's it's, it's, it's not. It's not the Polish. Because I think at the end of
the day before the product goes to the client that that is a polished product. Shaun Richardson
21:36 Because what I'm picking up from you. Yeah. Steven Joubert 21:48 There is a polished product,
but the actual the actual the, the, the, the. Mechanisms you can Polish that you know the the the
way it works. Shaun Richardson 21:58 Yeah. Steven Joubert 22:03 You, you, you the frame works, the
framework gets better and better each time. So then that's why today the product that you're going
to launch the product that you're going to give to a client is going to be a hundredfold better than
the product that you gave to a client 10 years ago, because you have that that comes with 10 years
of experience and no growth and knowledge. Shaun Richardson 22:03 So you're saying, yeah. Yeah.
Steven Joubert 22:26 So if you had to then go well, I need to give the I need to give the client the
perfect product. You're never going to deliver anything and we can look at Microsoft is releasing
patches and things all the time. If they never released. If they never released everything that was
done and checked, we wouldn't have, we wouldn't have had Windows 3.1. Shaun Richardson 22:34 Yeah.
Yeah. Steven Joubert 22:47 We would never got anywhere because it still needs to be polished the
entire time we're growing. We're developing, but at some stage this is good enough. Shaun Richardson
22:54 And not supposedly. Yeah. If you're looking in the context of like, let's just say a building,
a holiday homes for a client. And and I lay down the concrete foundations in in the, in the beach
pond. And the foundations are rubbish. Why should I spend all this amount of time working on the
internals of all the plumbing of the House when it's all sitting on these kind of? Steven Joubert
22:57 Yeah. Shaun Richardson 23:21 You know. Unstable foundations. When I know that the next home
I'm going to build is going to have better foundations because of the lessons I've learned. Steven
Joubert 23:31 Oh, I think you gotta take. I just need to be careful there. You make sure that when
you do have laid the foundations and that's something that I think you make sure that those
foundations are good enough for this project. Shaun Richardson 23:32 And. Hmm. Yeah. Steven Joubert
23:45 So you can't 'cause now. If you're gonna have a product that has got shaky foundations, you're
gonna have problems forever, you know. But if those foundation. But but if those foundations are
solid for today's project, then then you can move on. You can start building on that because today
I'm only building a house that is a single story. Shaun Richardson 23:53 Yeah. No, I mean. Well, the
best answer can today. Steven Joubert 24:07 Well, the best house that I can and I know that this is
what I need to deliver, whereas in the and that's how you grow because I didn't start with building
the programmes I'm building now. I started building small single single Storey houses and now we're
onto complexes and apartments and and and you know in in that metaphor. Shaun Richardson 24:12 Yes.
Yeah. Steven Joubert 24:27 Because because I know, I know that my foundations for this big project
is going to be solid. Each time you learn a better way to lay those foundations, you can. You can
take those the code source and you can you can use it again because. You're polishing it as you go.
Shaun Richardson 24:49 Yeah. And and like that point you're making me is something I subscribe to
quite. You know heavily is that? You you take along your own little toolkits over time, you know
little patterns that you've accrued that have worked very well. And and this is where you pick up
from other people in your team, like little patterns they've learned. When I was talking about
patterns, we'll talk about, let's say, how do you structure some classes, you know, to to deal with
this kind of? Steven Joubert 25:03 Yeah. Shaun Richardson 25:23 Specific problem you're trying to
solve. You do accrue these tools over time and and I really think that those things are special and
I agree with you overtime they get better and better as as they get tested. And I think that's the
key. Steven Joubert 25:38 Definitely, definitely you will. You will improve on them. You'll improve
on that. Maybe you're the codes is more efficient. Maybe the code is better to better standards.
Maybe you learn to refine it at the some point you maybe functions is not the best practise. Maybe
objects is the best practise, so then you got to mould your stuff, mould your code, mould your
thought pattern because. Shaun Richardson 25:39 Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Steven Joubert 26:05 You're
changing how you're working. You're changing. How your object looks, how your foundations look and
and on that you build your toolkit. Yes, exactly. Shaun Richardson 26:16 So, OK then let's let's
assume that we we. 'Ve gone to the client, we've we've broken down these problems and everything.
And now by the kind of exploratory process that we've gone in on delivering this client, we've
discovered that these this massive roadblock that we need to address. And we never, we never spoke
about it in the quotation phase or, you know, defining the project's scope or anything like that.
How do you go about presenting yourself like in that situation, you're going to go back to the
clients and you're going to say, look, you know, we we found something that needs a lot of work to
make happen in the current scope. Do you negotiate with him? Do you explain to them? Do you ask if
there's different, you know, like how do you approach that zone? Steven Joubert 27:07 You have no,
that's. That's where the project management side of it comes with. It's just different to the
programming where you need to. You need to understand that you're in a partnership with the client.
The clients come to you because of your expertise. Your skill set and you can provide that, but
neither they nor you did for saw this problem. Otherwise it would have been addressed right up front
and maybe maybe in doing this programme or the the project you're uncovering maybe a fundamental
issue in the company. So you always need to go back to the client. You need to manage their
expectation as to what they're receiving, because if you can, if this project is. A critical issue
that means you can't go on further, which means you need to have you need to fix the problem. You
need to get past it. Maybe it's not a critical, maybe it's just the again a nice to have or
something down the road that you can put a plug in that you can maybe say. Well, we'll come back to
this. We'll deliver this in the next round of development. But you absolutely need to be upfront
with the client. You need to communicate and then manage expectations based on what they know and
what you know that your scope is what you're going to be presenting, and if it's, if you never. If
this thing is critical, then you need to address it because the project can't go forward without it.
Shaun Richardson 28:26 Yeah. And I think a lot of people. Steven Joubert 28:32 In which case? In
which case you would need to then maybe put more resources into it more time. Finances, whatever
required if, unless this project, you know if they don't want to go forward with it, then this is
then a show stopper. Shaun Richardson 28:53 Yeah. And I think a lot of people kind of forget that
that's the the zone you're operating in is that? The person or or a client, especially when you're
working at the corporate level, they come to you for the expertise. I remember working in in a team
of people and there was a a group of individuals that are working on something completely unrelated
to what I was doing. They just happened to be in the same office and they were getting very, very
frustrated because. They they didn't have access to the system. You know, I don't know if they were
marketing guys or eco guys or whatever the case may be. But they didn't have access to the system to
make the changes to to enact the. And they were getting very, very frustrated about it. And and I
remember saying at the time like, why are they getting upset with the lack of access? They they've
delivered the knowledge, you know, and if the client doesn't want to enact their knowledge, if it's
not much you can do, really, they they ask for your expertise, you deliver the expertise, you know.
And I always thought to myself like. OK, that company may have done it an incorrect way, but I still
think that the knowledge you bring to the table is is definitely this kind of. You know, it's a
you're picking each other's brains, kind of saying, like, can we get this done? We really want this
done. Can you do this for us? And. And a lot of people jump and say, yeah, yeah, we'll do it. No
problem. We'll do it a week sooner than anyone else, and we'll do it 100 grand cheaper. Steven
Joubert 30:20 Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And three months down the lawns, they're nowhere. Because of these
critical issues. Yes, now. Shaun Richardson 30:35 Exactly. I mean, I think you know we we both have
a friend who spoke about this and he said in the beginning the software guys would say, look, we can
do project expansion in six months and he would go because he had pressure on his shoulders. He
would say, can you do it in three? And they were like we'll try our best and then they would have
they would miss the deadline in three months they would have several meetings after that and then
eventually deliver it in six months. Steven Joubert 30:54 So. Six, yeah. Shaun Richardson 31:04 So
you're actually just like, you know, what if the guy stays six months, it's going to be in about six
months, you know? Steven Joubert 31:11 Give them the six months, yeah. Shaun Richardson 31:12 And
and I think when you approach it as a relationship of professionals, you tend to be a bit more
flexible on those things. Steven Joubert 31:22 I think that's the thing you need to make sure you
need to remember that you're managing people. You're managing businesses, expectations and people's
expectations. So in the case where you're saying where the people are saying it's going to be 6
months down to three months, I think there in that situation the the people wanted to hear the three
months. And and and. If you tell him what they want to hear. But then you have to manage that
disappointment down the lawn. Shaun Richardson 31:49 Yeah, yeah, I'd rather, yeah, I'd rather not.
I'd be like this. Steven Joubert 31:52 I would roll. I would much rather be up front and then over
deliver as opposed to under deliver and say well, six months and we missed that deadline, missed our
deadline, missed our deadline, rather rather be real rather be upfront and if they if they know
these facts, they know these, these, these, these things they can make, then their business
decisions because they if they can't do be without the product for three months. Shaun Richardson
31:56 Yeah, definitely. Yeah. Steven Joubert 32:17 Those three months that you're busy with the
development, then they need to know that they can make decisions around that as well. Shaun
Richardson 32:23 Yes, exactly right. Steven Joubert 32:24 Yeah. And that also helps with
relationships because if they if you know in that relationship, then you promise then you delivered
within that time, the next time you have any sort of business relation that you need to deal with,
they're going to, they're going to listen. Shaun Richardson 32:40 Yeah. And if you know what, like,
I think you know, we've been training for about half an hour now. I think it's a good time to cut
off. I want to leave you the story that I came across the other day because my brother-in-law, he
sells cars wholesale. And I remember from, like, I've met quite a few sales people who've got that
kind of Sheen, you know that. Steven Joubert 32:50 OK. Shaun Richardson 33:05 The the they wow you
and dazzle you and ultimately like they don't really have the solution that you need. And so I think
I incorrectly got a negative portrait of a lot of salesman because I just want to allow you and I
just want to close the deal. But you know, I've been dealing with my brother-in-law now and he is on
just cut from a different part because he's like, what are you looking for? This is what I got. This
is the budget. And then he's brutally honest about. The collection of cars that he has and and he's
very open and and I thought to myself, this is a salesman because he's. Providing the customer with
all the options, all the information out-of-the-box, there's a there's a level of trust there and
he's like I might not have what you want today. Steven Joubert 33:50 Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Shaun
Richardson 33:57 But I'm always going to be open with you. I'm always going to be honest and I'm I'm
never going to try to pull a fast one and because of this, he keeps getting the same people coming
back and they're saying, you know what, this this guy, he always what he says it's on the turn, you
know. Steven Joubert 34:03 No. Yeah. Shaun Richardson 34:14 And it just kind of it just kind of
struck me that. You we we could definitely do it with a bit more kind of open transparency like this
in the software world. Steven Joubert 34:25 Yeah. No, I think it's best and that comes down to where
do you want the people where we're people. We're your people. So how do we deal with the people and
the problems? How do they want? How do I want them to perceive me? And I don't, you know, being a
good programmer is a great way to be perceived. But in terms of character, I'd rather them see a
good character. I want them to see the nature that I'm portraying. Shaun Richardson 34:25 Yeah. So.
Yeah. Steven Joubert 34:50 And if they're dealing with, then the character of what I'm portraying,
then they'll trust my development skills as well. Shaun Richardson 34:59 Yeah, I suppose they they
know that all round, you're a pretty decent guy who likes to stick to his word and deliver with, you
know, vigour and and and enthusiasm. So if they know the person, then it's not going to be a
surprise for every new job they're going to be, like, futile. They're kind of like the relationship
we had. Like when I saw Steven, I knew, OK, cool. I've got someone that I can approach with its
problems and sit down and hash out together and deliver. Steven Joubert 35:06 Yeah, yeah. News.
Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Shaun Richardson 35:27 Yeah. Well, thank you for your time, buddy. It's nice
to hear from you again. Steven Joubert 35:32 I appreciate this is this is fun. Actually, I enjoyed
it. Yeah. Shaun Richardson 35:35 It was fun, I think. I think you and I have got a long enough
history that we'll have a couple of interviews for sure. I've got some other people that I'd like to
interview. I think there's a lot of knowledge that gets lost when you're busy. Steven Joubert 35:48
Absolutely. Yeah. And I think also putting it out there, speaking about it also changes how you're
thinking and what you think about. Shaun Richardson 35:49 So these these short, yeah, these short.
Exactly. So I think before we part ways and we'll meet up again. Sure. Friends of here. Again. Is
there anything you want to plug? Is there anything you're interested about that you want to get out
there? Steven Joubert 35:59 So. Well, I just wanted to say that from when you were talking about
impostor syndrome, I think it was. For me, growing up, it was always. I was wondering can I do this?
Am I going to be able to be good enough? Yeah. And I think it's just that I've grown so much and
seen that I can accomplish anything. It's just a matter of breaking the problem down. Rethink what
you got to do. And then and then try and essentially, you know, create the puzzle pieces and then
see how you can put the puzzle pieces together. And I think if you approach that in in an or, I use
that in all aspects of my life, then it it it takes away, in my opinion, like the anxiety of life.
Shaun Richardson 36:44 Yeah. Steven Joubert 36:55 Put your head down, get the job done and you can
essentially accomplish anything. Shaun Richardson 37:02 That's what I did. Because, you know, you're
turning it into, like this kind of robot mode as opposed to a panic mode. A robot just needs to go
from X to Y, you know. And once you've kind of calmed these things down and put some understanding
to the things you need to accomplish, then it's just a matter of getting it done. APC, it's very
simple. As opposed to I don't know how to do this. I'm out of control. Oh, I'm a failure. Steven
Joubert 37:02 Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. Shaun Richardson 37:27 That it's impossible to to go
from A to B when you're in that frame of thinking. Steven Joubert 37:29 Yeah. Shaun Richardson 37:34
So yeah, I mean, you know. Steven Joubert 37:35 Exactly. Exactly. Shaun Richardson 37:37 Always a
great chatting with you buddy and and we're going to make sure we do it again. Thank you for the
time. Chat again soon, pal. All of this. Cheers. Steven Joubert 37:40 Thanks very much. Of course,
man. Thanks a appreciate it. Bye bye. Steven Joubert stopped transcription
